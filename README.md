# Java Crossy Road Remake
This project is a remake of the game Crossy Road entirely in Java. The game is run through the drawing panel where each frame of the game is drawn as quickly as the drawing panel class can process it. Like the original, players operate a character using the arrow keys and must traverse roads with deadly cars in order to gain points.
